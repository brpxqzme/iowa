        <h1>1. What the game is about:</h1>

        <p>At present, the gameplay is not terribly exciting. What you can do
        is visit various planets and star systems generated by the system. The
        intended economic activity was highly dependent on this component, so
        it was constructed first.</p>

        <p>Nonetheless, the generation is somewhat interesting, particularly
        in that we generate some text and graphics as well as astronomical
        data for a condensed (not particularly realistic) galaxy.</p>

        <h1>2. What is procedurally generated:</h1>
        <p>Please refer to the README for a fuller listing.</p>
        <p>We have procedurally generated stars, planets, names for all
        stars and planets, and noise-based textures for them.</p>

        <h1>3. Other techniques implemented:</h1>
        <p>We have a form of motion planning implemented that steers
        around planets. Our pilot is not particularly willing to leave
        the solar system's plane, so he never takes the easy way.</p>

        <h1>4. What are the limitations and issues with the game:</h1>
        <p>At present, minimap selection doesn't take you to the right place,
        the highlight on the minimap is also not working correctly, and once
        you travel to another star system, interplanetary travel doesn't seem
        to work properly. Loading a star system is regrettably slow due to
        the texture generation--this could be alleviated rather well by using
        worker threads.</p>
