CS 425 Project 3

1. Overview of game:



2. Division of responsibilities:

Primarily (but with significant overlap), group partners worked using the
following division of labor:

Alfie: Procedural generation, game engine logic
Sam: Motion planning, graphics

3. Use of procedural content generation:

This game is capable of generating a large number of star systems and planets.
It is possible to travel to these places in a spaceship. All of them have
names, sizes, live-generated textures, etc. and are (for all practical
purposes) unique.

Names are generated based on Markov chains with some adjustments to keep
names from being too short or too long for a galaxy of potentially billions
of objects.

4. Other technical components implemented in this game:

- Hand-modeled spacecraft
- Galactic generation cached in a component-entity system-like structure
- Noise-based texture generation on celestial bodies
- Keypress-based navigational system
- Text-based player message notifier

5. Required technique implemented:

Motion planning: The ship attempts to move between target planets without
colliding into one.

6. Is this game modeled after an existing game?

In some ways, this is modeled after some of the space-travel and trading games
in the vein of Elite, but neither teammate has intense experience with any of
these in particular.
