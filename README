CS 425 Project 3

1. Overview of game:

In this space simulation, you can travel to any planet in the system by
pressing the keys "1" through however many planets are in the system. You
can also travel to other stars by clicking them in the mini-map.

2. Division of responsibilities:

Primarily (but with significant overlap), group partners worked using the
following division of labor:

Alfie: Procedural generation (universe generation), game engine logic, multiple viewports and stars
Sam: Motion/camera planning, graphics system and rendering stuff, procedural generation (texture).

3. Use of procedural content generation:

This game is capable of generating a large number of star systems and planets.
It is possible to travel to these places in a spaceship. All of them have
names, sizes, live-generated textures, etc. and are (for all practical
purposes) unique.

Names are generated based on Markov chains with some adjustments to keep
names from being too short or too long for a galaxy of potentially billions
of objects.

4. Other technical components implemented in this game:

- Hand-modeled spacecraft
- Galactic generation cached in a component-entity system-like structure
- Noise-based texture generation on celestial bodies
- Keypress-based navigational system
- Text-based player message notifier
- The stars you see in the distance aren't just dots.
  They're systems. They're really out there.
- Minimap

5. Required technique implemented:

Motion planning: The ship attempts to move between target planets without
colliding into one.

6. Is this game modeled after an existing game?

In some ways, this is modeled after some of the space-travel and trading games
in the vein of Elite, but neither teammate has intense experience with any of
these in particular.
